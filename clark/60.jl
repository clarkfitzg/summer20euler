Find a k clique.
It might not be the smallest one.
Mutate d by removing keys for all nodes that cannot be in a k clique.
We'll still need to remove those keys from the value set too, but that can be another step.

Implementation Details:

We could initially filter out nodes to only keep those that are connected to at least k other nodes in this set.
That could substantially reduce the size of the problem.
